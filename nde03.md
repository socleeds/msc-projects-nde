## Outline of Project

This project would develop a tool to support modelling of threats
to system security.  The tool would allow threats to be categorised
according to the STRIDE methodology, and would provide some means
of drawing attack trees for each threat.  It would also provide
support for assessing risk quantitatively.  The tool would require
a graphical user interface.

The tool can be implemented in a programming language of the student's
choice, taking into account the fact that a cross-platform solution
is preferred.
