## Outline of Project

Hearing tests are usually carried out using pure tone audiometry (PTA).
Although PTA was developed for a human to administer under quiet conditions,
there is also great interest in developing automated, self-administered
PTA solutions using mobile phones.  Difficulties for PTA apps include
earphone calibration and environmental noise, making results inaccurate.

This project would examine the current state of the art in PTA apps and
identify shortcomings.  It would then develop and evaluate one or more
prototype apps that attempt to address these shortcomings.

The project would involve close collaboration with a lecturer from the
School of Medicine, who will provide the necessary audiological expertise.
