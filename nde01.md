## Outline of Project

The term [refactoring](https://refactoring.com) refers to a set of source code
transformation techniques aimed at improving the structure, maintainability,
extensibility and understandability of software, without changing its
observable behaviour.

This project would explore refactoring in a practical sense by developing
one or more tools to automate refactoring operations, in a programming
language of the student's choice.

The tools developed here could have simple command line interfaces or could
be implemented as plugins to an existing development tool such as Microsoft's
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
