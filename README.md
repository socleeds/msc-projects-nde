# MSc Project Ideas

Ideas for MSc projects with me in the School of Computing.

Click on a filename (`nde01.md`, etc) for details of a specific project.

Note that some ideas may be unavailable, having been done successfully as
projects in an earlier session.  Minerva is used to notify students of
which ideas are available as projects in a given session.
