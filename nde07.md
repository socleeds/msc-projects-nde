## Outline of Project

The School of Computing currently teaches mobile app development on
[Android][1] using the [Kotlin][2] programming language.  Using Kotlin is
sensible, given [Google's announcement in May 2019][3] that Kotlin is now
preferred to Java for Android development.  However, students come into
the Mobile Application Development module without knowing any Kotlin,
having used Java in earler modules.

This project would investigate the difficulties that students face in making
a transition from Java programmer to Kotlin programmer.  It would then
develop ways of easing this transition.  This could take the form of
some specific training materials, backed up by some form of self-assessment.
One interesting possibility would be to develop a training application that
presents the user with short programming exercises, checks them and then
awards marks and gives feedback to the user.
