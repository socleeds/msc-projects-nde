## Outline of Project

Software quality can be assessed quantitatively by computing various
metrics - e.g., the cyclomatic complexity of methods, Robert C Martin's
abstractness and instability measures, etc.

This project would develop one or more software tools capable of analysing
existing software and computing these metrics.  It would also explore
ways of visualising these metrics and trends in their values during software
development.
