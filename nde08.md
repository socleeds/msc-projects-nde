## Outline of Project

The School of Computing currently teaches mobile app development on
[Android][1] using the [Kotlin][2] programming language.  However, Google
also provides an alternative approach to app development, using a
cross-platform framework named [Flutter][3].

Is Flutter a viable alternative to developing native Android apps in Kotlin
for the Mobile Application Development module taught at Leeds?  What would
we gain and what would we lose by switching to Flutter?  What is the
development experience for Flutter, compared with native Android app
development in Kotlin?  Would it be easier to teach to students?  Would
students value a cross-platform approach?  Would employers consider it
useful experience for students to have?  This project would seek to answer
some or all of these questions.
